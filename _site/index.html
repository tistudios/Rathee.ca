Pragmatism is an important skill to cultivate no matter who you are but especially for people that are new to development. Anyone that doesn’t cultivate it will end up getting thrown off course/following a tangent AKA distracted and not realize it until it is too late.</p><p>What you can expect to learn on this website depends on your goals. I want to help beginners learn the way I taught myself. I still remember what it’s like to be a beginner and my frustrations are with the overwhelmingly obtuse documentation online published for and by developers.</p><h1>I never wanted to be a developer.</h1><p>I’ve always been a more physical guy who wanted to study policing or get into digital marketing. Definitely not a developer.</p><p>You may not like what I show you or you may agree with my methodology.<br /> <strong>In either case the important thing is what you’re trying to do gets done.</strong> <br /></p><p>Laziness is another skill I want you to cultivate. But it’s not just regular laziness, it’s smart laziness. Luckily for you smart laziness comes from trial and error and I’ve already done those on your behalf.<br /> <br />I recommend and wholeheartedly use and encourage the usage of good tools, shortcuts, etc. Anything that can be used to shorten the length of time in development and get a project to production. This website isn’t for every single person. It requires an open mind, a willingness to be honest with one self, and a flexible mind.</p><p>Why am I doing this? Because if even one person is helped then I consider it a worthy endeavour. For myself it’s a good way to track what I know and how well I know something.</p><p>My ultimate goal is to show how anyone can go from zero to full stack successfully. This requires that they don’t give up.</p><h1>Lesson Plan</h1><p>Mastery of each path is measured by your ability to create and deploy projects of any kind and type in that path. I only teach technologies and tools that I can use in harmony to form a total project. You will not a course here on PostgreSQL just by itself because I personally am not an expert in any of these things when taken down to their individual components.</p><p>I publish one post a day so stay in the loop and keep checking back here. As I publish articles I will organize them here and in the menu.</p><p>Cheers!</p></main><footer> <small>This project is maintained by <a href="https://www.danurbanowicz.com" rel="noopener">Dan Urbanowicz</a>.
